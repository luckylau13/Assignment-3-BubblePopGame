## About the app
### Overview
Our app is a cloud-based shopping list that is designed for families to share lists with one another. In order to create a list, only one user has to register and once registered, they can create and share lists using a uniquely generated alphanumeric code. The shared list will update in real-time if another user modifies any item in the list. Any user can edit the list items with the code given.
### Features
This MVP is capable of:
1. Registering new users
2. Signing users in
3. Resetting user passwords with Firebase
4. Creating a new list with a unique code
5. Viewing the user's created lists and the share code, with the option to delete the list
6. Adding and removing list items along with toggling the status

### Implementation
This is a **minimum viable product** which utilises `Google Firebase` for user authentication and `Google Firestore` for storage.
#### Firestore Data Model
Our Firestore project contains two subcollections, `users` and `lists`. <br>
Each **`user`** document is identified by their email used to sign up with Firebase Authentication and has the following fields:
- **`firstName`**	: String
- **`lastName`**	: String
- **`lists`**			: Array of Strings (Unique code of all lists generated by the user) <br>

Each **`list`** document is identified by the unique alphanumeric code generated and has two fields:
- **`listName`** : String
- **`items`** : Subcollection of a custom object with the following fields:
  - **`completed`** : Bool (Indicates whether object is bought)
  - **`title`**     : String (Name of object)

### Troubleshooting
All pod files should already be installed but if you have trouble building and running the app, ensure [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is installed. Once installed, `cd` to the project directory and run `pods install` on the terminal.
